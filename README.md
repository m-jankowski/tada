# TADA - The Text as Data App

This repository contains all files of the Shiny Application. The app is under development. 

You can access the most recent stable version at: https://tada-gui.shinyapps.io/tada/. 

When you have RStudio installed, you can open the app on your local machine.

```r
# If shiny package is not installed
install.packages("shiny")

library(shiny)

# Easiest way is to use runGitHub
runGitHub("tada", "stefan-mueller")
```
