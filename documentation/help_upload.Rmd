Please select a `.csv`/`.xlsx`/`.sav` (SPSS)/`.dta` (Stata) or `.rds` ( R ) file. Currently, all texts must be part of _one_ spreadsheet. If you have the texts in separate files, you can use [this R script](https://github.com/stefan-mueller/texts-to-corpus) to transform the data to a format that is supported by TADA. [Here](https://github.com/stefan-mueller/texts-to-corpus/sample-data) you can download sample `csv` and `xlsx` files that have the structure required for TADA.

The file must contain at least one variable which contains text. TADA will automatically select a variable from your data which contains text. You can change this variable by providing the variable name of the text variable using the **Name of Text Variable**-box on the right.

It is often helpful to specify a **Document ID Variable** which contais a label for each document in the corpus. When you do not specify this ID then default names will be used ('text1', 'text2', ...). The corpus may also contain additional **Document-level variables** associated with each document. The **Variable Overview** box shows you how each document-level variable is coded (either character, numeric or integer). Before you proceed, make sure that the variables are coded as intended.

If you only want to learn how TADA works, you can use a predefined data set of Irish Party Manifestos 1990-2011. Simply select the option **Use sample corpus**.

Note that you will need to **Create a dfm** from your text corpus to use the **Text Scaling** and **Topic Model** functions.
