Correspondence Analysis (CA) is a scaling technique that is similar to a standard principal component analysis but applies to categorical rather than continuous data. This is the case when we work with a document-feature-matrix which counts the occurence of a word for each document. Will Lowe has demonstrated in a paper entitled 'Scaling things we can count' that the Wordfish model and correspondence analysis are very similar and produce strongly correlated results [(Lowe 2016)](http://dl.conjugateprior.org/preprints/scaling-things-we-can-count.pdf). In contrast to Wordfish, however, correspondence analysis extracts several dimensions from the data. You can limit the number of estimated dimension by using the option **Number of Dimensions**. Correspondence analysis does not support the estimation of confidence intervals.


You can download the scores (and confidence intervals) for each document as a `csv` file. If you include the **Merge results with docvars** option, all document-level variables will be attached to the CA estimates. Moreover, it is possible to retrieve the CA estimates for the texts as a plot with **Point Estimates**, in a **Stacked** boxplot or density plot (you need to specify a grouping variable). You also have several options for customising the plot (**Labels**, **Title**, **Plotting theme**, and **Font size**). The plots can be downloaded as a `pdf` or `png` file. Make sure to adjust **Width** and **Height** according to your needs.
