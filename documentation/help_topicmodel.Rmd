**Topic Models** are based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which assumes that each corpus consists of multiple Topics and that each Topic consists of multiple words. With topic models users can discover the main themes in a collection of documents (see extensively [Blei et al. (2003)](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-lda.pdf) and [Blei (2012)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf)). 

Please specify the **Number of topics** that should be identified in the text. The topics are assumed to be generated before the documents have been written. The identified Topics can be interpreted based on the word which belong with the highest probability to the Topics. **Seed** sets a random number generator. Finally, you can specify the **Number of burnin iterations** as well the **Number of iterations** and determine the **Number of words dispayed for each topic**. Press **Estimate LDA** to start the LDA.
