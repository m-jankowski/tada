The **Wordscores** option implements the wordscores scaling model developed by [Laver, Benoit and Garry (2003)](http://faculty.washington.edu/jwilker/tft/Laver.pdf). Wordscores are a scaling method for estimating the positions (mostly of political actors) for dimensions that are specified a priori. Wordscores is widely used among political scientists. For problems and shortcomings of the approach see [Lowe (2008)](http://faculty.washington.edu/jwilker/559/Lowe.pdf).

To score the documents (need to be converted to a **Dfm** first), you need to specify so called reference texts in your text corpus. These texts require reference scores that are stored in a **Scoring Variable**. You need to specify the name of the scoring variable.  Afterwards, Wordscores estimates the positions for the remaining **virgin texts**. Moreover, there are three scaling options for the Wordscores estimates: raw, [LBG (Laver, Benoit and Garry)](http://faculty.washington.edu/jwilker/tft/Laver.pdf) and the [MV (Martin and Vanberg)](http://people.duke.edu/~gsv5/PA2008.pdf) transformation.

You can download the scores (and confidence intervals) for each document as a `csv` file. If you include the **Merge results with docvars** option, all document-level variables will be attached to the Wordscores estimates. Moreover, it is possible to retrieve the Wordscores estimates for the texts as a plot with **Point Estimates**, in a **Stacked** boxplot or density plot (you need to specify a grouping variable). Moroever, with the **Features** plot you can plot the scores of the features as a measure of relative frequency. You also have several options for customising the plot (**Labels**, **Title**, **Plotting theme**, and **Font size**). The plots can be downloaded as a `pdf` or `png` file. Make sure to adjust **Width** and **Height** according to your needs.
