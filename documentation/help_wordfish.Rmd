An alternative to the Wordscores method is the **Wordfish** Poisson scaling model of one-dimensional document positions ([Slapin and Proksch 2008](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.420.1849&rep=rep1&type=pdf)). Wordfish also allows for scaling documents, but compared to **Wordscores** reference scores/texts are not required. Wordfish is an unsupervised text scaling method, meaning that it estimates the positions of documents solely based on the observed word frequencies. Texts are positioned on a single dimension based on these word frequencies. Documents with similar word frequencies are placed on similar positions while documents with large differences in word usage are placed on very distant positions on the dimension. You first need to transform your text corpus into a **Dfm**. To determine the "direction" of the documents, you can specify the texts that would correspond to the ends of the dimension using the **Left anchor** and **Right anchor** fields, and you can easily adjust the **Confidence intevals**.

You can download the scores (and confidence intervals) for each document as a `csv` file. If you include the **Merge results with docvars** option, all document-level variables will be attached to the Wordfish estimates. Moreover, the Wordfish estimates for the texts can be plotted with **Point Estimates** or as a **Stacked** boxplot or density plot (you need to specify a grouping variable). Moroever, with the **Features** plot you can plot the scores of the features as a measure of relative frequency. You also have several options for customising the plot (**Labels**, **Title**, **Plotting theme**, and **Font size**). The plots can be downloaded as a `pdf` or `png` file. Make sure to adjust **Width** and **Height** according to your needs.
